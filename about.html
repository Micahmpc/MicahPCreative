        <h6>Bio:</h6>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Micah and I'll be your tour guide today. Thank you for coming to check me out, and welcome!
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. My father is a computer programmer and systems director, and my mom a lawyer. Needless to say I had a lot of exposure to technology, and to arguing about everything, AHEM... I mean how to think analytically and construct arguments based on information. I frequently got in trouble for disagreeing with teachers, and winning. For some reason they hated that, don't ask me why. Thanks, MOM.
        </p>
        <p>
          I attended Evergreen School as a youth where I learned how to think and learned computers. At Eckstein Middle School where I attended 8th grade, I began taking an interest in drawing - mostly due to the fact that I was frequently bored in class. Next I attended Garfield High School where I took advantage of photography classes - learning composition, and also how to use Photoshop (this was in 2001/2002, mind you). I was also still drawing and painting constantly, and also learning about typography and lettering through some of my mentors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In college I double majored in Graphic Design and Business Administration, and graduated in 2009 with honors in design. In the design program I learned the Adobe graphics suite, and took a real interest to it. I also worked as a student assistant in the type lab where letterpress classes were taught, and worked as a design tutor for younger students in design. My final project won me my  honors in graduation. I designed a whole umbrella company's portfolio for the counter-culture skateboard industry, complete with a line of decks, magazine features, and branded apparel. This would come back into play after college.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the business program I focused on marketing and strategic analysis. For my final project for Global Marketing, I was praised by the professor for having the best final project, where we had to create and design a marketing strategy for a product to enter a foreign market. My product - a car security / navigation / assistance system and service (similar to Onstar, but WAY better, of course!). I was also at the time into wiring mine and friends cars with sound systems and security so it was fun to dream... I positioned it in France where car theft was high, with high populations of car owners in urban areas, among other factors. My capstone was a full competitive analysis and strategic plan for microprocessor giant AMD.
        </p>
        <p>
          After college, I took a few months off relax and travel to South America. Upon return I began working as a cook at a nearby pub, and designing and printing my own t-shirts on the side, on a silkscreen press I built out of wood for about $20 bucks. Although I only sold about 50 shirts over the course of 2 months doing B2C sales (LOL) on the street and at festivals, it eventually led to a job pressing apparel for the holiday seaon at Prep Sportswear, where I would stay and move up through the company for the next 7 years until moving on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently I am freelancing doing web design and development, and working on an apprenticeship through Bloc, where I'm adding more experience in UX/UI design and research, and adding to my portfolio. Lately I've also been voraciously reading about human (and some animal) psychology, science of the brain and thought, and measuring user data and analytics. Ask me to recommend a book, I'd love to talk your ear off!
        </p>

        <h6>Mission:</h6>
        <p>
          To design, architect, and build products and solutions that provide answers to problems. Always seek more information to learn, iterate, and improve. To create strategies for approach as well as product positioning. And to take pride in my work, as reflects not only on the product, but on me as well.
