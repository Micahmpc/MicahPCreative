          <p>
            Hello and welcome! My name is Micah and I'll be your tour guide today. Thank you for coming to check me out!
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm a multitalented designer and strategist with a background in user experiences, web interfaces and full sites, branding, and marketing among other things. In my free time, I pursue hobbies like woodworking in my home shop, and fishing where the bite is good (or not so much).
          </p>
          <p>
            I find it incredibly gratifying when you are able to master something to the point of habit, allowing you to keep reaching further into expertise and further progression. I think the best feeling in the world is conquering a challenge. Through design, I'm able to create systems and strategies that solve problems for the user, and in a way that can be easily managed through streamlined processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a background stemming from a young age in art and design. In high school I pursued drawing, painting, and photography, and my junior year became involved in glassblowing and volunteered by helping out with classes for community service, and on their production team under the guidance of my glassblowing mentor - who taught me a lot about life as well as art. Like a classic coming-of-age drama.
          </p>
          <p>
            While drawing and painting, I also took an interest in lettering and typography. Again I had mentors showing me the ropes, this time seeking guidance from older siblings of my friend group who were local artists and who I took classes with at Seattle Central CC, where I was earning high-school and college credits doing the Running-Start program.
          </p>
          <p>
            In college, I double majored in Graphic Design and Business Administration and graduated in 2009. My senior year I worked as a studio assistant in the typing lab where letterpress classes were taught and worked as a design tutor for younger students in the major. My capstone earned me honors in the Design. I designed a skateboard company, complete with a line of printed skateboard decks, magazine spreads and ads, and branded apparel.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the business program, I focused on marketing and strategic analysis. For my final project in Global Marketing, the professor who wrote the book on the subject (literally, he wrote the popular textbook we used) gave me praise for having the best final project. The goal was to research and create a marketing strategy for a product to enter a foreign market. I positioned it in France where car theft was high, among other factors. My capstone project was a full competitive analysis and strategic plan for microprocessor giant AMD.
          </p>
          <p>
            After college, I took a few months off to backpack through South America. When I returned I found a job as a pub cook and designed and printed my own line of t-shirts as a side hustle (on a silkscreen press I built out of plywood and 2x4s, I might add). That eventually led to a job pressing apparel Prep Sportswear. I ended up staying on with Prep and continued to move up through the company for the next 7 years. I've also done freelance work on the side.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am freelancing doing web design and development, and working on an apprenticeship through Bloc, where I'm gaining more experience in UX/UI design and research, and continuing to build and improve my portfolio. Lately, I've also been voraciously reading about psychology and the brain sciences in hopes to better understand how people think. Ask me to recommend a book - I'd love to talk your ear off!
          </p>

          <h4>Mission:</h4>
          <p>
            To design and build products and solutions that provide answers to problems. To always seek more information in order to learn, iterate, and improve. To create strategies for approach and execution, as well as design and positioning. And to take pride in my work - as it reflects not only on the product itself but on me and the teams I represent as well.
