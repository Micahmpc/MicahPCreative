        <h6>Bio:</h6>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Micah and I'll be your tour guide today. Thank you for coming to check me out, and welcome!
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. My father is a computer programmer and systems director, and my mom a lawyer. Needless to say, I had a lot of exposure to technology, and needing to logically structure my arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I attended the private Evergreen School as a youth where I we learned how to use computers at an early age (many Evergreen students go on to attend Bill Gates’ alma mater Lakeside which is down the street). When I transferred to public school in the 8th grade, I began taking a real interest in drawing and art – mostly doodling and writing my name in the page gutters of my homework assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Garfield High School I took advantage of photography classes – becoming familiar with composition, layouts, color theory, and using early Photoshop (circa ’01 or ‘02). I also worked as a photographer for the student newspaper The Messenger. On the side, I was still drawing and painting constantly, and also took an interest in typography and lettering which I learned from some of my mentors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In college I double majored in Graphic Design and Business Administration, and graduated in 2009. My senior year I worked as a studio assistant in the type lab where letterpress classes were taught, and worked as a design tutor for younger students in the major. My capstone earned me honors in the Design. I designed a skateboard company, complete with a line of printed skateboard decks, magazine spreads and ads, and branded apparel.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the business program I focused on marketing and strategic analysis. For my final project in Global Marketing, the professor who wrote the book on the subject (literally, he wrote the popular textbook we used) gave me praise for having the best final project. The goal was to research and create a marketing strategy for a product to enter a foreign market. I positioned it in France where car theft was high, among other factors. My capstone project was a full competitive analysis and strategic plan for microprocessor giant AMD.
        </p>
        <p>
          After college, I took a few months off to backpack through South America. When I returned I found a job as a pub cook, and designed and printed my own line of t-shirts on the side (on a silkscreen press I built out of plywood and 2x4s). Although I only sold about 50 shirts over the course of 2 months, it eventually led to a job pressing apparel for the holiday season at Prep Sportswear. I ended up staying on with Prep and continued to move up through the company for the next 7 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am freelancing doing web design and development, and working on an apprenticeship through Bloc, where I'm gaining more experience in UX/UI design and research, and continuing to build and improve my portfolio. Lately, I've also been voraciously reading about psychology and the brain sciences in hopes to better understand how people think. Ask me to recommend a book - I'd love to nerd out!
        </p>

        <h6>Mission:</h6>
        <p>
          To design and build products and solutions that provide answers to problems. To always seek more information in order to learn, iterate, and improve. To create strategies for approach as well as positioning. And to take pride in my work - as it reflects not only on the product but on me as well.
        </p>
