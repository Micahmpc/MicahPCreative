          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>
            aetlas is a crowdfunding and fundraising platform that is targeted around sustainability and green tech. I worked on this project on my own, and was self-guided, with a little assistance from my senior designer/mentor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal to build a crowdfunding platform was presented to me, but with little direction. After doing a business analysis for the market and competitors, I found a niche area to focus on and exploit in sustainability products and initiatives. Here's how we got there...

          <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            The main competitors for this platform were Kickstarter, IndieGogo, GoFundMe, and Fundly.  The former 2 on the "crowdfunding" side, the latter "fundraising".
          </p>
          <p class="txt600">
            Findings:
          </p>
          <p>
            The crowdfunding sites were much "sexier" in their design which added to their initial curb appeal, they had global reach, and a ton of content. They functioned similarly to an e-commerce site. Their biggest weaknesses were they're payment models and their lack of trustworthiness on deliverables for campaigns. Those stuck out as big areas opportunities for improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fundraising sites in contrast were slightly less attractive, and had heavy ties to social media for campaigning, They offered low cost of entry if any which was a big strength. However this also allowed any and everyone to join, meaning people were using it to benefit from others sympathies - even going to the level of fundraising for bills, rent, and car payments, which had the same effect as crowdfunding - in losing user trust due to misguided use of the tool.

          <p>
            The user stories were created based on the research and inherent nature of the tool. In the task flows, some of the important feedback collected during the interviews helped to guide the options at a number of steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notably, things like the adding the option to choose between the two main types of funding, instead of being defined by the platform. Tools/features for later versions were discussed too, such as adding certain risk aversion tools to the campaign setup process to improve success rates on delivery of incentive packages, and helping the projects grow stably into their next stage of business.

            Architecture

          <p>
            It was unclear how to break down possible projects so I ran a card sort with Optimal Workshop to create affinity diagrams and define the different top-level categories. That broke the site down into Products, Global Action (& aid), and Community Projects (outreach). From there it was deemed projects could cross over if their cause suited.

          <h4>Design</h4>
          <p>
            After the structure was all sussed up, the site went right into wireframes. I started with low/mid level wires, detailed enough to roughly exact spacing and font-sizing, but no logo, color, content, etc. Once a number of the user stories were finished enough in that form, a number of things went to split testing to get them right, and a prototyped flow for some of those was shopped around to make sure some of the interactions were logical and correctly linked up.

            Once the preference tests were running with the low res mockups on  UsabilityHub, and the prototype was being user-tested in InVision, the logo and branding work was done while waiting on results. To this point the concept was essentially nameless and faceless.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name <span class="txt600">aetlas</span> was chosen based on the mission of the platform, and the ties to Greek mythology and the titan Atlas who was tasked with holding up the sky (though often confused with holding up the earth, which in this case worked out fine). It lent to the globe, to supporting the earth and environment, etc.

            Successes
          </p>
          <p>
            I took this project end-to-end, from concept to proof of concept. I think it succeeded in solving a lot of the problems it sought to, such as thinking through the campaign set up (although the POC didn't really touch on it - as that flow is pretty desktop dominant, and the design was only done as a mobile site). Specifically discussed were management tools like funding-calculators that helped campaigners properly break apart their costs to lower non-delivery rates of incentives.

            Lessons Learned
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was not as successful at creating a habit loop as I had hoped for. I believe the brand identity successfully played to users emotions and the growing awareness of the need to create sustainable products and technologies, but the reward part of the habit loop was less successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            The research showed that users rarely interacted with other users or shared projects on social media, thus removing some of the habit forming elements related to peoples desire for social interaction. Instead it sought to reward users through their own desire to do good, which was not necessarily a small desire, just possibly not rewarding enough. I think however if triggered by something (e.g. seeing news of a global disaster), users might be reminded of their desire to help, in which case the identity surrounding the site might draw them here versus to the competitors platforms.
