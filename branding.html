        <h4 class="slab">Craigslist (Concept)</h4>
        <p>I did a concept project on a Craigslist rebrand (which is funny because shortly after I finished, they actually, finally, rebranded in real life). I started out with some mood boards and brainstorming, then jumped into the design. Here it is:
        </p>

        <div class="project-image">
          <img src="assets/images/pages/branding/cl_moodboard.jpg" alt="Youth Sports Product Page">
        </div>

        <div class="project-image">
          <img src="assets/images/pages/branding/craigslist_early.png" alt="Youth Sports Product Page">
        </div>

        <p>I was liking the direction I was going, but hadn't really ventured outside of Craigslist purple in terms of color so that needed to be addressed. What did purple mean? What colors speak to what you saw in the moodboard in terms of building trust, and speaking to what services the brand actually provides? I still wasn't feeling the iconography 100% either up to this point. I was close but the icons didn't really do the brand mission justice.
        </p>

        <div class="project-image">
          <img src="assets/images/pages/branding/cl_styleguide.png" alt="Youth Sports Product Page">
        </div>

        <p>One thing I wanted to experiment with was the concept of scalable graphics. So I designed the logo and the relevant spacing on the multiplier scale which I thought actually turned out really well. I used color to try to bring a certain feel to the brand, one of trust, and little organic - as in the possibilities of what's here are as far reaching as the mind can wander.</p>
