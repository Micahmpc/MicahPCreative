        <h4 class="slab">Craigslist (Concept)</h4>
        <p>I did a concept project on a Craigslist rebrand (which is funny because shortly after I finished, they actually, finally, rebranded in real life). I started out with some mood boards and brainstorming, then jumped into the design. Here it is:
        </p>

          <img src="assets/images/pages/branding/craigslist_early.png" alt="Youth Sports Product Page">
        </div>

        <p>I was liking the direction I was going, but hadn't really ventured outside of Craigslist purple in terms of color so that needed to be addressed. What did purple mean? What colors speak to what you saw in the moodboard in terms of building trust, and speaking to what services the brand actually provides? I still wasn't feeling the iconography 100% either up to this point. I was close but the icons didn't really do the brand mission justice.
        </p>

        <div class="project-image">
          <img src="assets/images/pages/branding/cl_styleguide.png" alt="Youth Sports Product Page">
        </div>

        <p>One thing I wanted to experiment with was the concept of scalable graphics. So I designed the logo and the relevant spacing on the multiplier scale which I thought actually turned out really well. I used color to try to bring a certain feel to the brand, one of trust, and little organic - as in the possibilities of what's here are as far reaching as the mind can wander.</p>

        <h4 class="slab">Lake Forest Park Municipal</h4>
        <p>Lake Forest Park Municipal Court approached me to redesign their logo and identity package, as well as help out with a campaign they were working on. What I realized halfway through and after a few rounds of back and forth on the left and right versions below, was that they wanted more of a refresh really. So I took their logo and essentially simplified it to a more iconic look. The iconography relating to a court in a little township at the end of a lake, surrounded by trees - which is exactly who they are. Here's a look at some of the early versions, and the eventual final product:

        <h4 class="slab">Compound Brewing</h4>
        <p>A close friend of mine and I had gotten into brewing beer a number of years back. As the hobby progressed he decided he wanted to take it a step further and start a nano-brewery with some of his perfected recipes. He didn't really have a name he was set on or anything he was super passionate about including in terms of style or iconography. The brewery started in the same large garage where we had his woodshop - he was a carpenter and woodworker by trade. And his house, a 3000 square foot rectangle, was aptly named the Compound. So there you have it, the inspiration behind the logo. I designed a  And in case you were wondering, the answer is yes. I did work in exchange for sudsy compensation.
