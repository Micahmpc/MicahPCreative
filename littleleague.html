        <h4>Background:</h4>
        <p>Prep Sportswear formed a partnership with Little League of America and Russell Athletic to build a fundraising and e-commerce platform which all Little League leagues and teams would be migrated to for league and team management.
        </p>
        <p>
        Little League wanted a platform that stored all their team/league data; had fundraising capabilities that tied into our licensed sales; and a linked e-commerce site that allowed customers to shop for custom licensed merchandise for their kids' teams and leagues (of which a portion of the sales went back into their fundraising account). Russell recently scored the Little League jersey contract, so the new site would feature primarily their brand of fan apparel.
        </p>
        <p>
        We needed to re-platform our current site which was aging, so this was a great opportunity for us to rebuild a new system that could handle our future scalability needs, and was better suited for mobile shopping and the current state of the industry.

        <ul>
          <li>New architecture: Built for the future, tied to the past.</li>
          <li>Improve task-flows and UI</li>
          <li>Improve user-customization process</li>

        <h4>Process:</h4>
        <h6>New architecture: Built for the future, tied to the past.</h6>
        <p>
          A new platform meant new/improved data structures. Mapping for everything was needed - granual data pertaining to products, designs, and stores. What a "product" or SKU entailed was debated on. Was it deconstructed into a combination or string of all the data taken from the item being put into the cart? Or was it more encompassing like a distributors SKU - in which a single SKU included all sizes, colors, etc. into a single entity?
        </p>
        <p>
          One difficult part was that there were minimum-viable-product and time considerations, so that meant building a system that was done right so we could build upon and scale it for the future, while also tying in data from the old site. With things like color - which actually became one of the most difficult to solve problems - we had to start fresh so I helped build the architecture of how products, designs and stores would handle color considerations. For other things like what a SKU actually was, we had to take more of a bridging the gap approach, omitting pieces of data, replacing them with new structures, and in some cases having to go all the way backward and update on the old site as well just so both sites worked properly.
        </p>

          <h6>A Study on Perception</h6>
          <p>
            A few months before we started the project my creative director and I - when I was working as a design architect/graphic designer on her team - ran a small study on how people perceive color in terms of a sports-based platform like ours.
          </p>
          <p>
            We gave a handful of people 2 different printouts, one page with a number of different shades of red, and the other with green. Both sheets had a number of color names we found in our database like "crimson" and "cardinal" (colors associated with major D1 schools). We asked the participants to match the names with the swatches they believed they belonged to. This study came out of a top-prio request I recieved from upper management to "ensure we're printing the right colors" according to individual store data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The results? We would have had more matches in sea of snowflakes. Not only did practically no one write the same name on a certain swatch, but no one chose the correct name that the particular swatches actually pertained to of the D1 schools (our control for this experiment).
          </p>
          <p>
            I mention this because we used it to help guide our decisions about the new system. We couldn't please everyone all the time because perceptions simply vary too much, so we needed to account for that variance and create processes to minimize error.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h6>Improve task-flows and UI</h6>
        <p>
          Task flows were a hot topic of debate. How did the customer get from signing up for a league in Arizona, end up on our site buying shirts and shorts? How did the league admin gain access to league data, and what happens next year when there's a new league admin? In the landing-to-purchase path, we could have reinvented the wheel to mimic more our competitors model, but that would have removed some of our strengths in exchange. We stuck with the old model, but simplified it by combining some of the steps of the old system.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was the UI developer for the project so I wrote all the HTML and CSS for the sites. I had some wiggle room on styling as long as I stuck to the layouts from our UI designer, and I also was given the reigns to create the style guide. I started building it in an atomic fashion, first nailing down the atom level elements like fonts and colors, and building molecules like form fields and buttons and grids. I didn't make it all the way up since there wasn't time, but the new site was so much more legible and cohesively branded.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ran a CSS test on the old site that crawls your code and generates a list of unique elements and properties. There was something like 200 colors, 65 font sizes, etc. So I made it my goal in writing the CSS to limit myself in such areas. I had 14 font sizes I could use (h1-h6 and p, with an "alt" modifier I could plug into the html element), about 6 or 8 colors total, and limited my options for things like padding sizes and adding new classes. The best part? Changes were incredibly easy, and only needed to be made in one place (for the most part). Transitioning to SASS was the next step however I left the project before that happened.
        </p>

        <h6>Improve user-customization process</h6>
        <p>
          Our platform was built on the ability to manufacture 1-off custom apparel. That meant the user was dropped into a store (of their choosing), and could design their own product from a series of pre-defined options. Product, product color, design, text, text color, etc. So one of the things we wanted to do with the new platform was to create a better system for filtering which enabled the user to make many of the choices as they went, versus mostly on the final "design" page. Seems normal enough, but with the old system, it was not. It just wasn't how the processes were built at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our solution was to provide the option to the user sooner. That way, if a user knew what they wanted - at least somewhat - by the time they got the final page before checkout, there was less work to do to complete their goal of creating something they wanted and buying it. Less tasks all at once = less user frustration = more willingness click that magical checkout button. I worked with our designer and developers to figure out what our MVP's were for the initial release, and then built it out.
        </p>

        </div>


        <h6>Handling of different parts of the platform (fundraising vs. e-commerce)</h6>
        <p>
          Our current site had been our only site up to this project, so we had to figure out first how to handle the new site since we needed the current one to stay live, and we couldn't piggy back on the old system because that's what we moving away from. Second, we had to decide what to do with the fundraising piece, since it was a seperate entity, under the umbrella of the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few tries we landed on segmenting into subdomains "powered by" the umbrella. Each new piece we built would get its own subdomain, and would remain branded while allowing for some autonomy in the look and handling of each. This allowed us to keep the site segmented for a future migration, and afforded the user way less confusion by omitting cross-references to the other pieces.

        <h4>Afterword:</h4>
        <p>We released the 2 sites (e-commerce and fundraising), cohesive in branding, processes, and interactions. We built a simple system that separated each piece of data, making an easily maintainable platform. One thing we lacked in this project due to time constraints was a great level of external user research prior to release. Instead, we did all company-wide showcases along the way and iterated from this feedback as we went so we could continue moving forward. Not surprisingly, the customer service team provided very valuable feedback as they were our ear to the streets.
