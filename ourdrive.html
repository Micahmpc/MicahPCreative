          <h4>The Problem</h4>
          <p>
            The point of this project was to create a SAAS that allowed users to store content from the web and that they created in some cases, and be able to share that content with other users in a collaborative environment. Enter, OurDrive.

          <h4>Strategic Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            The first thing I did here was draft up a competitive analysis. Competitors I defined were Box, Google Drive, and Dropbox, to name the major players. Fortunately, this was something I did a lot of in college business classes, so I did a pretty decent job. I also started learning where I could fit into the space, and where the others lacked so that I could capitalize on those areas for my product.
          </p>
          <h4 class="marg-top30">Research</h4>
          <p>
            Next, I started conducting user surveys using Google Forms and following up with some of the users that provided me contact info with a post-survey interview. The survey was pretty generic and while created by me, it was guided by project requirements that included some general questions to be used. This, unfortunately, didn't provide too much info as the questions were almost too generic to extract much useful information. The interviews, however, proved key in providing me with insights into the user behavior and allowed me to come up with a few different persona's that each painted a different picture of how they would use my product.

        </div>

        <p>
          Doing the interviews led me to my core issues I needed to address. The three biggest common points users spoke on were wanting as few clicks as possible from grabbing their phone to entering new content; an app where they could house images, notes, links in an organized and searchable system; and the ability to share the content with specified users.

        <h4>Strategy & Planning</h4>
        <p>In doing the user flows and sitemaps, I was able to figure out the shortest paths to allow the user to upload content. This process logically led the dashboard to be opening page for returning users to reduce clicks-to-add (Open app > Add > Type of Content > User adds content). For desktop users, removal of the opening-the-app step would be possible with either a browser add-on or by simply keeping the app open in the background while you work.</p>

          The user flows also helped to illuminate what pieces were not part of the MVP and could be held-off on until future releases. Those steps were still worked through, however, and are shown in yellow in the flows.

          The next step before I really jumped into any design was to develop the branding. It needed to be an identity that was simple and heavily text-based to stress the brand name, but it also needed to include an iconic element that spoke for itself. These were also characteristic of many of the worlds most recognizable brands. Simple, powerful, recognizable. I finally landed on the identity below after countless versions and edits to both the logo and color scheme. It took a bit longer than expected, but in my mind, it had to be just right to set itself above the crowd. Not apart from the crowd necessarily as it's a crowded space, just better than.

        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>
          I started working out the wireframes for all big pictures using Balsamiq so I could quickly bust through a few different versions to choose from, and work through a few pieces that needed to be accounted for. For example, the payment flows depending on the user and their current plan level. The homepage got a few versions as well which were more layout focused versus the payment wireframes which were process-centered.

        <p>
          You'll see in the example on the right that the branding isn't the version seen earlier. After working through some of these higher def wireframes, I realized I didn't like the look of the product. It was too run-of-the-mill-tech space with the various shades of appealing blues, so I went back and moved to the green you're now familiar with to give the brand more of the identity I was going for. This step is also where I start visualizing every instance of user interactions. I also quickly realized, one too many artboards in Illustrator can crash your computer quick fast and in a hurry!

      <div class="project-sect">
        <h4>Testing & Takeaways</h4>
        <p>
          These wireframes were all compiled and put into InVision for round 1 of prototype testing. I sent them out via link and UserTesting.com for some videos of the tests. I got some valuable feedback here about after having to update my task statement - the original one wasn't specific enough on the functionality level of the prototype (which was still very low at the time). Many of the users who tested it failed to get past the sign-in fields that didn't actually allow input, while the sign-in button signed you in by default. This of course due to the fact that it was in early prototype form and was built with static images, not yet a coded site. I was astonished though by the unwillingness to push the CTA until the fields were filled in. Lesson learned on my part. If the user can't figure it out, it's on the design(er), not the user. A quickly added sentence to the last statement, however, fixed the problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          The next step was to build and start testing again. I created high definition prototypes using Photoshop to mock up the files and brought them again into InVision as a static, clickable prototype. The working prototype was sent to a number of my Slack groups to test, as well as doing some live testing where I sat down with some local Seattle users and completed a few of the core tasks that Ourdrive provided. Then I again did follow-up interviews.

        </div>

        <p>
          These weren't nearly as useful as the early rounds of interviews, which really gave me a window into what the user wanted. Here I think, since the user was placed farther along in the process with guidelines and flows now created, the testing lent itself more to quality assurance. There were so many pages it was hard to keep track of every piece that needed to be linked up. Fortunately, I only missed a small few, and those were caught in the earliest tests so revisions were made before many more tests were started.

        <h4>The Build</h4>
        <p class="txt600">Trust the Process, DO the process.</p>
        <p>
          This project was a bit of a weird one. As it was guided by a series of assignments, it only required designs for a desktop application. What I noticed early on though was there wasn't really so much as a nod to mobile, or what this would look like in a responsive layout. Much of my user feedback actually pointed to the mobile user being a much more frequent target than on desktop. Since the content was images and links and notes, it pointed toward the mobile user on the bus or waiting around somewhere flipping through their phone (Then VOILÀ! they see something they like, save it, and share it on the spot).
        </p>
        <p>
          The decision then that I faced, was essentially guessing on the design for mobile, or backtracking and redoing all the designs again for mobile. Backtracking that far wasn't much of an option since it would have taken too much time at this point, so onward I trekked... went... coded, whatever.
        </p>
        <div class="device-mockup">

        </div>
        <p>
          I ended up building it for desktop-first since that's how I could see my design as I went. Most of the questions took care of themselves too, which was nice. The side nav in the dashboard folded up nicely into a hamburger menu, so that was easy. The tile layout I built so it would just wrap as you shrank your screen so that too played out well. Overall, it wasn't really a huge set-back, just a minor un-planned element that next time I would approach differently. But sometimes time and budget constraints can force these issues, so we move on and learn from the experience.
