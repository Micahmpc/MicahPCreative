        <h4 class="slab">The Idea</h4>
        <p>I was contacted by a startup called Sweet Meeting to be their email developer. They were launching a company whose goal was to increase the value of meetings within the workplace. They wanted to provide a review system where the users - anybody who goes to meetings - could rate meetings and provide feedback that would be compiled and parsed back out to attendees in order to provide insight on how to increase the value going forward.
        </p>

        <h4 class="slab">The Strategy</h4>
        <p>They had designed a set of about 8 triggered emails which served as their main avenue of communication with the user. The user would log into their account to schedule meetings, which would trigger the typical invite email with the date and time. After the meeting, all the attendees would receive a rating email with a simple good or bad rating they could choose based on how the meeting went.
        </p>

        <div class="project-image">
          <img src="assets/images/pages/sweetmeeting/rating-error.jpg" alt="Youth Sports Homepage">
        </div>

        <p>They would then take all the data provided by the user and shoot out another email with the report of the meeting. They would also send out individual reports to the users based on their stats and ratings. All of these were color-branded with their positive or negative theme they created.
        </p>

        <div class="project-image">
          <img src="assets/images/pages/sweetmeeting/longitudinal.jpg" alt="Youth Sports Homepage">

        <div class="project-image">
          <img src="assets/images/pages/sweetmeeting/reports.jpg" alt="Youth Sports Homepage">
        </div>

        <p>I worked completely remotely on this project and provided their designer/developers insight into how to approach the dynamic aspects of of the email such as the scores and linked graphs. All the design communication was done via Zeplin for the files. The emails were designed without much regard for what's possible in an email, so there were some coding kinks that needed to be worked out as well.
        </p>

        <h4 class="slab">The Outcome</h4>
        <p>The company never really took off after launch. Part of the issue I think was in the business analysis of both what their product could provide and what the rest of the space was providing their users. They were going up again some heavy hitters that were quickly making names in the space like GoToMeeting who offered a similar product, but with included screensharing, and a number of other useful tools to actually improve the capabilities of meetings. On the good side, the design in my mind was leaning in the right direction of simplicity and color coating things to create familiar associations. And they had a lighthearted touch to their verbiage, which could either be a pro or a con depending on who you ask.</p>
        <p>One issue I spotted early on though had nothing to do with how good the competition was, but rather a matter user engagement and experience. The company had a website you could use, but was pretty email focused which raised a flag, as eventually all emails can turn to spam in the users mind. Also, other than recommending how to improve meetings there was no real incentive for the user to interact. It's a lot of extra work to provide feedback on every meeting you go to, especially if it was a bad one, and simply telling the user where improvements could be made doesn't incentivise the user to actually make those improvements. Therefore, the whole rigamarole is simply time taken out of your day.
        </p>
        <p>Ultimately they never really took off and were to the wind shortly after launch. But for me, other than the pain of hours spent fighting with internal CSS, it was interesting to see some of the choices made and how I would have done things differently were I in the driver seat. As they say, you learn more failure than you do from winning.
